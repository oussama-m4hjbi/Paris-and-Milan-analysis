# Paris-and-Milan-analysis
 
## "Welcome to my Paris and Milan Infrastructure Power BI Project!

### This project provides an in-depth analysis of the transportation, energy, and communication networks in the cities of Paris and Milan. Using data from various sources, the project offers interactive visualizations and dynamic reports to allow for easy comparison and contrast of the infrastructure in these two iconic European cities.

With this project, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of:

- the number of airports and railway stations in each city
- the types of transportation available in each city
- the amount of renewable energy and gas stations used in each city
- communication networks and cell towers in each city

### Whether you're a student, researcher, or just curious about the infrastructure of these two cities, this project is a valuable resource for gaining insights into the infrastructure of Paris and Milan.
### - In addition to the infrastructure analysis, this project also includes a simple linear machine learning model for predicting theft incidents in Milan. The model is built using Python and the scikit-learn library and is trained on a dataset of historical theft incidents in Milan.

Please note that the data used in this project is from 200 2021, and may not reflect the current state.

To run the project, you will need to have Power BI installed on your machine and the data sources used in the project should be connected in the report.

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or pull request on Github.
